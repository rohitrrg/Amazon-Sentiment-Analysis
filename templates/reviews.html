      <td>After a long time, I've purchased wired earphones and I'm so happy with this product. Super good! I'll tell the pros, cons and what all it comes with.Inside the package: Earphones, 2 extra pairs of buds, warranty card, cloth pouch and stickers.Pros-1) The quality of these earphones is A1. The wire is thicker than I expected that too in just Rs 300. Very less chances of tangling. The best quality.2) Quite long wire which is again a plus point for me.3) Bass and sound quality is just magnificent for this range of a product. Loved it.Con-1) Just one off thing I felt is that the earpiece size is too small. Could have been slight big in size. But can ignore that, as it has so many advantages.Definitely a go-go product.</td>

      <td>I bought JBL C50HI, Wired in Ear Headphones about 1 year ago. The price of JBL C50HI Wired in Ear Headphones at the time of purchase was ‚Çπ 549. If 6% inflation is also added to this, then today's price will be ‚Çπ 582. But I bought this Boat BassHeads Ear Headphones for just ‚Çπ 299 with which I got 4 extra muffs and a carry pouch. Also, let me tell you that the JBL Headphone did not have a carry pouch. Overall I saved ‚Çπ 283 on this purchase and got the carry pouch free. In the end, I would like to tell you that if you are looking to buy this product, then you will get complete satisfaction.</td>
