      <td>The quality is descent, and the connectivity is fast and smooth , battery backup is good . But the most important thing which should have been good was the sound quality , but sadly it isn't . The sound is same as like the aound of your mobile apeaker . The earphones has no bass and the music or whatever you listen completely sounds flat and irritating . My free Nokia earphone was better than this based on sound quality . The product looks good and the bulid quality is amazing with great features . But looks doesn't matters the audio qulaity is completely poor . If you want to own earbuds just for fashion then go for this , but if the sound quality matters for you then i will suggest to buy traditional wired earphones , atleat the sound quality is better on those wited earphones .</td>
