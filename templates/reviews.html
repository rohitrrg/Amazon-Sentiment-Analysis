      <td>Well this was my 1st day of using the mouse and well things were not the best.1st the sensor light wasnt working and the rgb lights too and the scroll button click was hard to click and majority of people in minecraft (game) use butterfly clicking (clicking method) for combat and the main thing is that I am 11years old and the mouse hardly fits my own hand.I am just 11years old and this mouse does not fit me,what a great disspointment.well I am gonna take another mouse which is way reasonable in size and this mouse is not that confortable as expected in the pictures the side buttons were always troubling when I was using the mouse and for those who wants to play fps games like valorant the pulling rate is about 1000hz</td>

      <td>The media could not be loaded.                Â Okay, so first of all I am not a pro gamer, but I do play FPS, TPS, RPG.Before I write anything regarding Logitech G G402 USB Hyperion Fury, I want to let you guys (especially gamers who are looking to buy this mouse) know that I used Circle Marksman 1 for 7 years, which I have uploaded in first picture right next to the G402. After 7 years it started disconnecting and so I wanted the same mouse but unfortunately it wasn't available online so after lots of research I decided I will go with G402.Review:1: I am not a pro gamer but I regularly play Valorant and I am an Ascendant 1 ranked player also a Chamber main. I am stating this because the people who play valorant knows you need precise headshot to take down opponents with the headhunter, so after using marksman 1 for 7 years I feared that new mouse may not give me the same precision or it will take some time for me to adjust, surprisingly nothing like that happened and I got hooked to G402 very quickly.2: Now I am kind of player who doesn't really care/check what my DPI settings are (I just keep note of my ingame sensi settings and control settings), so it took me some hours to fix my DPI on this mouse and on the 2nd Image i have uploaded my DPI image. (For this you need to download Logitech Gaming Software vr 9.02)3: Now playing valorant, I am a Vandal user and hardly ever use Phantom. For me connecting head with the vandal is easier than spray controlling the phantom, although the clip I uploaded is me trying my Phantom with this new mouse and boy, I can actually spray control the phantom better with G402 than compared to my marksman 1.*OFF GAMING*4: The overall look and build is good. I got this mouse for 2,279Rs/- (I was a little annoyed that some others got this mouse under 2000Rs/-, but ig it was some special offer that they got it). I ordered this mouse by reading all the specifications thoroughly because I wanted a mouse that weighs and has the built similar to my marksman 1 so it'll be more easy to use.Now this is only 1 week of usage. I will update by review after a month than after a year :)I hope this mouse lives as long as my marksman did.</td>

      <td>The mouse is pretty heavy. Coming from G102 ~90gms to this ~150gms is almost double and it's so heavy that you can't flick anymore. You will have to adjust your gameplay to fir this mouse. You can't do low sensitivity flicks anymore, you have to have higher sensitivity.It's not worth it to change your whole playing style to fit the mouse and for that reason I have ordered another gaming mouse that's around ~90gms itself.Also, the top two extra buttons keep getting pressed even if you just accidentally touch it and anything you have mapped to it gets triggered. You will have to disable the extra two mouse buttons so don't go running happy that it has two extra buttons.I wish I did my research before getting the mouse. Just get a lighter mouse ~90gms or less. Don't buy it.Unless you are ready to change your play style to higher sensitivity and more precise shots but it will take time for you to adjust. A lot of time.</td>

      <td>Proud 2+ years user of the g402 here!!it has certain querks,like it's heavier when compared to similiar budget range mouseand it's largerthese two querks make it the perfect choice if you have a large palm and use hybrid aiming technique (i.e use your wrist and fingers for micro-adjustments and arms for bigger movement)if you are looking for a lightweight mouse then it's probably best that you find something else tbh...g402 caters to those who need precise stable aim and depend on flicking instead of tracking.Apart from these certain querks which ultimately comes down to personal preferencethis probably has the best sensor out there in this range....ik the dpi range isn't that high but if you are into fps you most certainly stay within the 3200 range right?you can actually feel that the accuracy of this way above avg(avg being the otherice in this price range)when paired with a good mousepadthe side buttons are ergonomicthe dpi sniper button can be easily be bound to a macro and used as an additional side button and comes in handy in situationsand the logitech software is a breeze to use compared to R-synapse or some other periferal managersthe scroll wheel button is a bit mushy and i don't use it as muchthe scrool wheel is ok .... probably not the best but nothing to scoff at  at allnow where this mouse really shines....Longevityi've been using this mouse quite heavily (8+hours of gaming for 2 years mostly cs seige and some other titles)the buttons feels just like as it was 2 years agothey haven't lost the crispy feel to them which they had when they were brand new.the rubber coating is getting worned of in certain places but barely noticeableOverall if you are looking for accurate sensor and longevity and you have a perticular grip and aiming technique this can be a very good mouse for you !!!</td>

      <td>THE WIRE OF THE MOUSE WORE OFF on the connecting end, in just about a month. And the quality of the wire is trash, absolute trash. I am a person who keeps my mouse safe inside a hard case, and uses it with ultimate care, making sure the wire doesnt bend too much, but doesn't matter how good you take care of the mouse, the wires will wear off in the connecting end for sure. Horrible quality. And i spoke to the amazon team regarding repair or refund, they gave me the logitech support number. I called them to just know that warranty is not claimable for this since it is considered a "PHYSICAL DAMAGE", I mean, yeah looking at the picture, he decided someonw just ripped off or pulled the mouse's cable, but nah man, nothing, it was given ultimate care and I don't even think my own son would be getting so much care man. No one pulled the mouse, or never in life the mouse fell off or been pulled, nothingh!!! Its just that one day it was connected and I was casually using it until I realised the end of this cable was wearing off, in just a month. LOGITECH, I AM SOOOOO DISAPPOINTED for such a trashy wiring quality. Other than that, the mouse is really really good to use, good DPI SETTINGS, great for GAMING, veryyy handy, veryyy ERGONOMIC, totally worth the money if your WIRES, are at least upto the bare minimum expectation, the WIRES OF THE mOUSE ARE PATHETIC AND HORRIBLE, looking at the brand value you guys have. Also NO CLAIMABLE WARRANTY(as informed by the logitech support team) FOR SUCH A CHEAP BUILD OF THE WIRE, which is absolutely your fault, I see it as a win for you. I bet, I have also used a Rs.100 mouse, and even the wires in that mouse was pretty thick and durable. Dear Logitech, a REALLY GOOD WIRED MOUSE with PATHETIC WIRES, man its like ROLLS ROYCE WITH WOODEN TIRES, it still makes it unusable bruv, highly disappointing mouse and service DEAR LOGITECH</td>
