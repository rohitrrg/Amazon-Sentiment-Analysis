      <td>Coming from an iPhone XR (which I used happily with no complaints at all for 3+ years), the iPhone 14 plus made for a huge upgrade, in terms of display, battery, camera etc. Now, if you already have an iPhone 13, it doesn't make sense to go for the 14 given that the upgrade is negligible, but if you have an older iPhone (X/XS/XR/11/12), the new iPhone/Plus is a visual treat.I wanted a larger display without splurging on the Pro variant, and I love that Apple has introduced a Plus variant (something they did last with the iPhone 7 in 2016), for folks like me.I've had the 14 plus 256gb variant for just a day now, and here are my initial thoughts:1. Battery: An absolute beast. Out of the box it had ~45% charge, and 24 hours later it's just touching the 15% mark now after fairly extensive usage (browsing, gaming, streaming music)2. Setup: Buttery-smooth onboarding, took all of 15 mins to transfer data from my old phone to my new one. Had a bit of trouble pairing my Apple Watch with my 14 plus though, that wasn't the best of experiences.3. Display: A treat for the eyes! The supersized 6.7 inch screen makes for a beautiful experience as you stream OTT content, play games, or use the camera for photography/filming. However, since the display is so large, a lot of content tends to look blurred/out of focus.4. Camera: Gorgeous, gorgeous picture quality even in low light. Again, not an upgrade from the 13, but for people like me, the camera is an absolute delight.5. Build: The supersized 6.7 inch screen feels large in my hands, but no heavier than my iPhone XR. It feels comfortable enough to hold for hours as you watch, browse and game. In other words, despite the mammoth size, it feels as light as its smaller iPhone counterparts.6. Colour: Ordered the lavender shade, but it's not a very pronounced colour. In daylight it looks almost white.7. Delivery: Pre-ordered on 23rd September, received it on 9th October (2 days after it released). Kudos to Amazon for the super prompt delivery!Will update this review as I continue using it, but so far I am extremely impressed!</td>

      <td>If you are planning for iPhone with larger display and larger battery. Go for this. Pro max is 50k higher than this model. But for most users this will be awesome!</td>
