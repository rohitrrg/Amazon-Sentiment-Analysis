      <td>A very good looking phone. Looks very stylish and expensive. Terrific camera both front and back. Only drawback is the battery which is not so good. But this drawback is covered by the 80W charger which charges from  5% to 95% in about 25-27 min.</td>

Even though there is 4500 mah battery but it doesn't act like that.4. Looking at the quality and future of the phone, this phone is expensive.</td>

      <td>I have been using OnePlus 5 since last 5 years. So think of upgrade. But this phone is missing some basic things like notification LED, headphone jack, call recording without concent, auto call recording feature etc.Camera is not as good as OnePlus 5, Provided cover is slipperly, many applications like Gmail etc not syncing and giving notifications in real time. I know it is not the phone's fault but Oxygen OS is now mixed with shitty Color OS from OPPO. Origial OnePlus pure Oxygen OS was pure bliss.The phone is overall fine and suits my purpose. But still it is not upto the mark for above reasons. I won't recommend buying it.What I liked is fast fluid performance, very good fingerprint cencer (bit slow but still good) and fast charging.</td>

      <td>just want to share my feedback on OnePlus Nord 2T 5G), I bought this product on 1st Oct, unfortunately, that order is defective. So I was planning to replace the order.I cannot replace it because as per the latest policy, the technician will visit and verify the phone and then the replacement process will start.Now the pain point is that I am staying in the Pune location(Not in a Village area ) you can consider Pune as a metro city, but still I didn't get a call from the technician for visiting.I am an active and regular prime member of amazon, but this time I would say one plus Nord amazon replacement policy is worst because you know mobile is something that keeps us connected with our loved ones regardless of the distance. I would say I am stuck here and can't purchase another cellphone also.If possible please rework this policy and resolve my concern ASAP</td>
